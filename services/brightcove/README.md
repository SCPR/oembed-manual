## Brightcove

You may only embed a Player, not individual Videos. So, in order to embed a Video, you'll need to create a Player and add your Video to it. That process is outside of the scope of this tutorial.

Once the Player is created, follow these steps:

1. Login to Brightcove's "Video Cloud".
