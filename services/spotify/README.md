3. The correct URL will be copied to your clipboard.


### Embedding albums or playlists

This works exactly the same way as embedding a single song, except instead of clicking the "three dots" icon, you should right-click the album/playlist title.

Alternatively, you can simply copy the page's current URL when you are viewing an album or playlist.
